# Coeus - A Learning Module Provider

This implements the [LMS](https://github.com/Tuccinator/lms) to provide learning material in a consistent manner. This will stay up to date with the Learning Module Standard.

### Who is this for?
- Course creators
- Hobby enthusiasts
- Companies

### What is it?
Coeus is an open source course creator at heart. It will allow you the ability to 
create courses, questions (either for the courses or separate), sample projects, accept payments, 
speak with students.

### Why use this over X?
Everything has to start somewhere. This is the genesis project that implements the Learning Module Standard.
A standard that I have come up with to help keep all your learning in one place. The consumers will use it
to gather all learning materials from external sources (learning module providers) and integrate them into their
learning module platform of choice. Gone are the days of accessing courses (Udacity, Udemy, Coursera) and answering 
questions (LeetCode, Project Euler, etc) from copious sources.

You can use Coeus to create all of your courses, stay involved with your students, accept payments, 
and most other things a typical course creator can do, minus discovery.
